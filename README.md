Implementation of NEAT on NES based Game

Neuro-Evolution Augmenting Topologies: NeuroEvolution can optimize and evolve neural network structure, and the NEAT algorithm was one of the first to show it as a viable approach. 
Typically in Neural Network fixed structure of network is being used but what if it evolve through Genetic Algorithm? That's a really good idea.Now the problem is how do we will be 
encoding and representing individuals genetically in
