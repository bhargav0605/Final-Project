Implementation of NEAT on NES based Game

## Neuro-Evolution Augmenting Topologies: 
NeuroEvolution can optimize and evolve neural network structure, and the NEAT algorithm was one of the first to show it as a viable approach. 
Typically in Neural Network fixed structure of network is being used but what if it evolve through Genetic Algorithm? That's a really good idea.Now the problem is how do we will be 
encoding and representing individuals genetically in algorithm and how the algorithm will handle evolutionary process like selection, mutation and cross over. In biology, we have a 
genotype and a phenotype. A genotype is the genetic representation of a creature and the phenotype is the actualized physical representation of the creature. Evolutionary algorithms
always heavily mirror biology, neuroevolution being no different in this respect. In terms of encoding there is two category direct and indirect.
